AIM : First sentence with all 3, then with 2 at a time(3 sentences) and then 3 more single token sentences. Thus total for 3 keys at a time, i would get 7 sentences. The logic of having 7 sentences is that let's say one of the scientist does not have one of the keys, then obviosuly the sentence with all 3 would not be the starting sentence, thus we would be shifting to the 3 2keys sentence. And we will choose the sentence out of that that has those 2 keys. Also, take a case wherein the scientist has only 1 out of the 3 group of keys i have chosen, then the sentence with all 3 and all 3 sentences of 2 keys will not be used. Then we would shift to the 3 single token sentences and choose the one which has that key. Thus out of these 7 sentences, we will always have 1 sentence chosen given whatveer combination of keys is presernt out there for that particuar scientist.
